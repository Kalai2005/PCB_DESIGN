# AI Assisted PCB Generator

AI Assisted PCB Generator is a web-based intelligent application that automates
power supply PCB design using AI-driven decision logic. The system converts basic
electrical requirements into optimized circuit topology, component selection,
and ready-to-edit KiCad schematics.

## 🚀 Features

- Instant topology selection (Buck / Boost / Linear)
- Precise electrical calculations
- Optimized component recommendations
- PCB layout guidelines and best practices
- Downloadable KiCad schematic output
- Clean React-based frontend with traditional CSS

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters input voltage, output voltage, and current
2. AI logic selects the suitable circuit topology
3. Electrical parameters are calculated automatically
4. Components are optimized based on constraints
5. KiCad schematic is generated for further editing
